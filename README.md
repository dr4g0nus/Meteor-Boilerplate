# Meteor Boilerplate #

I have created this repo as an easy way to start a new barebones Meteor app. I have tried to keep it extremely minimalistic and it is primarily aimed at developers who just want to start a new Meteor project without copy and pasting an old one or re-reading Meteor documentation.

I will keep improving this as I learn more about Meteor. For example, I'll add acceptance testing as soon as I fully understand how to use Nightwatch with Meteor.

### Core Features ###

* Typical directory structure already created
* Mobile config file with some basic options
* Included packages (from meteor list)
    * accounts-password
    * accounts-ui
    * http
    * iron:router
    * meteor-platform
    * mike:mocha

### Contribution Guidelines ###

I am open to discussion about improvements and people's opinion in general on what are the best practices and what has worked best for them with Meteor. Just drop me an email or send a PR and we'll talk.
